# arkonas-labrynth
A functional Labrynth from Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path.

My husband (the forever DM) ran this dungeon a couple weeks ago, but it was sort of a mess and felt like a slog at the table because there was too much to keep track of.

So I thought it would be a fun project to try and recreate the dungeon in a functional web app. That way if we ever need to go there again (unlikely since it collapsed but still)
That we would have a better way to keep track of everything.

Thanks!
